## Questions?

**Q: Can I use flux in a commercial product?**  
A: Yes! But hardware contributions must be shared back (CERN-OHL-S copyleft).

**Q: Can I modify the assembler for my own ISA?**  
A: Yes! Apache 2.0 allows this, no need to share changes.

**Q: Can I use the documentation in my course**?  
A: Yes! Just attribute flux and share your materials under CC-BY-SA.

**Q: Do I need to share my test programs?**  
A: No. Your programs are yours (unless you choose to share).

**Q: Can I tape-out an ASIC using flux?**  
A: Yes! If you sell chips, you must share the RTL changes (CERN-OHL-S).
