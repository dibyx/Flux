# flux GPU - Democratizing GPU Building

**Breaking down barriers in GPU architecture education and development**

---

## The Problem

For decades, GPU architecture has been **locked away**:

### 1. **Proprietary Implementations**
- NVIDIA, AMD, Intel keep architectures secret
- No way to study real GPU internals
- Learning limited to high-level APIs

### 2. **Expensive Tools**
- Commercial EDA tools: $100,000+ per year
- FPGA tools: $5,000-50,000 licenses
- ASIC design kits: $10,000-100,000

### 3. **Corporate Gatekeeping**
- Only large companies can design GPUs
- Startups face massive capital requirements
- Innovation limited to established players

### 4. **Educational Gaps**
- Universities teach theory, not practice
- No hands-on GPU building experience
- Gap between learning and doing

**Result**: GPU expertise concentrated in a few companies. Innovation stifled. Students can't build what they learn.

## The flux Solution

### 🎯 Mission: Democratize GPU Building

**Make GPU architecture accessible to everyone - students, hobbyists, researchers, startups.**

### How flux Changes Everything

#### 1. **100% Open Source** 💰
```
Traditional GPU design:  $500,000+ in tools
flux GPU design:         $0 (or $150 for FPGA)
```

**All tools are free**:
- ✅ Yosys (synthesis) - FREE
- ✅ OpenLane (ASIC flow) - FREE
- ✅ SkyWater PDK (silicon) - FREE
- ✅ Cocotb (verification) - FREE
- ✅ Python (assembler/simulator) - FREE

**Savings: >99% cost reduction**

#### 2. **Complete Implementation** 📖

flux provides **everything**:
- ✅ Full RTL source (1,600 lines) - not a toy
- ✅ Working graphics pipeline - real rasterization
- ✅ Software toolchain - assembler, simulator, firmware
- ✅ 9,000+ lines documentation - atoms to chip
- ✅ 11 professional diagrams - visual learning

**Not just theory - actual working code you can study, modify, and build.**

#### 3. **Real Hardware** 🔧

You can **actually build it**:

| Platform | Cost | Timeline | Difficulty |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Simulation** | $0 | Today | Easy |
| **FPGA** | $0-150 | 1 week | Medium |
| **ASIC** | $10-300 | 6 months | Advanced |

**Compare to commercial**:
- Traditional ASIC: $5,000,000+ (multi-project wafer)
- flux ASIC: $10-300 (open-source shuttle)

**99.994% cost reduction for silicon!**

#### 4. **Education First** 🎓

flux teaches the **complete journey**:

```
Atoms → Transistors → Logic Gates → ALU → GPU → Silicon
```

**Learning path**:
- Week 1-2: Semiconductors & transistors
- Week 3-4: Logic gates & building blocks
- Week 5-6: ALU & instruction sets
- Week 7-8: Complete GPU architecture

**Result**: Students go from zero to building a working GPU in 8 weeks.
